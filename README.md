## Treeware

You're free to use this package, but if it makes it to your production environment I would highly appreciate you buying the world a tree.

It’s now common knowledge that one of the best tools to tackle the climate crisis and keep our temperatures from rising above 1.5C is to [plant trees](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-48870920). If you contribute to my forest you’ll be creating employment for local families and restoring wildlife habitats.

You can buy trees at https://offset.earth/treeware
